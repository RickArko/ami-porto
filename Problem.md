# Problem Statement
Good drivers wind up paying more than they should while bad drivers wind up paying less than they should for insurance. The goal is to **predict the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year**. This will allow Porto Seguro to better tailor prices and make coverage accessible to more drivers.
